#### Closed Loop
Sample ASP.NET MVC project that use url parameters to explore tree-like structure of categories.  
Instead of urls like:  
/Category/NameOfTheCategory  
we can use:  
/Category/Category1/SubCategory/SubSubCategory/SubSubSubCategory

It can be useful for integration with user-tracking software (e.g. Google Analytics) & Content Loop Marketing.
